I am a second year PhD student in the [Computer Science Theory Group](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/theory/index.html) at the University of Toronto, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Allan Borodin](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bor/) and [Nisarg Shah](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/index.html). I am also a graduate fellow at [the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/news/schswartz-reisman-institute-announces-2025-26-graduate-fellows) and am affiliated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai).

My primary research area is **Social Choice Theory**, a field that looks at how groups of people should come to collective decisions when the people's preferences over outcomes may differ. Particularly, my work involves formalizing what it means for a decision to be "Fair", and coming up with effective ways to find the fairest outcome for any given situation. This has applications to designing better voting systems and elections, finding better ways to allocate resources, and even in deciding how AI systems should behave.

I am also very interested in other fields at the intersection of Computer Science and Economics (such as **Algorithmic Game Theory** and **Mechanism Design**), and in the design and analysis of **Online Algorithms**.

If you ever see me somewhere and don't feel like talking about computer science, I am always happy to talk about [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7IS1CorZLYmoB0pbNiGtej?si=f2e33124ca3148d3), movies, and board games.
