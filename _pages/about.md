I am a first year master's student in the [Computer Science Theory Group](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/theory/index.html) at the University of Toronto. My main research interests are Algorithm Design and Analysis. Particularly, I am very interested in designing algorithms to solve problems in **Algorithmic Game Theory**, **Social Choice**, **Fair Division**, and other fields at the intersection of Computer Science and Economics.

If you ever see me somewhere and don't feel like talking about algorithms, I am always happy to talk about [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7IS1CorZLYmoB0pbNiGtej?si=f2e33124ca3148d3), movies, and board games.
